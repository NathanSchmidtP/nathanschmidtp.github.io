    Before I knew much about computers
    --- going as far back as middle school even
    --- hobby electronics was my main pass--time.
    Initially many of my projects were tied to the physics of radio transmission,
    a highlight of which was building a number of Spark-Gap Tesla Coils.
    This led me to participate in a number of high school science symposiums,
    once even at the national level.

    It wasn't until high school that my interests spanned to modern electronics:
    things involving integrated circuits or transistors at all, for that matter.
    Around my freshman year of high school I started cloning electronic synthesizers.
  </p>
  <p>
    My most memorable project from that period involved cloning the bass drum section
    of a Roland TR-909 onto a sheet of perf-board. It was an absolute rats nest, but
    it worked well enough that I was satisfied. At one point during testing, the end
    of a 500m coil of wire (which I had been using as part of a white noise source)
    came loose and snagged on <i>something</i> in the circuit. The speakers output
    immediately changed from a dull repetitive thump to the Beatles' <i>Revolution</i>.
    That was the first of four times now that I've accidentally made a radio receiver
    while building a circuit.

  <p>
    My most significant ongoing project is to design a modernized modular synthesizer.
    This involves designing all the basic parts of a modular system --- VCOs, VCAs,
    VCFs, ADSRs, etc... --- but with the additional goal of researching the integration
    of computers into a modular system for the purpose of sequencing.

    Occasionally I'll have a reason to build something unrelated to music synthesis.
    The physics department I work for has prompted this a couple of times.
    Other times its some odd novelty thing that people keep requesting.

    Some of the most interesting things I come across are things that someone wants me to fix.
    Half-century old pinball machines, Soviet-era synthesizers, lab equipment, etc...
